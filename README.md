# Backbone.rel-fetch

Backbone.rel-fetch extends your Backbone Models with the `relFetch` method.

## Dependencies

- [Backbone.rel](https://github.com/masylum/Backbone.Rel)
- [Backbone.partial-fetch](https://github.com/masylum/backbone.partial-fetch)

It uses the Backbone.rel `hasMany` and `belongsTo` relations.

## Usage

The `relFetch` method allows you to partially fetch a collection to update the related Model/Collection.

### Example in 1-1 relation (belongsTo)

Where you normally would use:

```js
task.rel('user');
```

using `relFetch` you would be able to use:

```js
task.relFetch('user', {success: onSuccess, error: onError});
```

In this example `relFetch` would make an HTTP request to fetch the user model.

### Example in 1-n relation (hasMany)

Where you normally would use:

```js
task.rel('comments');
```

using `relFetch` you would be able to use:

```js
task.relFetch('comments', {success: onSuccess, error: onError});
```

In this example `relFetch` would make an HTTP request to fetch the task' comments.

## Tests

You must have node installed in order to run the tests.

```
npm install
make
```
